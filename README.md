# "Closed Issue Message" Action for GitHub Actions

This action sets a default message to be commented on all issues or pull requests when they get closed.

## Usage

Add a YAML workflow file into your repository under
`.github/workflows`. 
This workflow file follows the 
[standard workflow syntax for Github Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).

For a list of options and their description, see [action.yml](./action.yml).

### Example Workflow
```yml
name: Closed Issue Message
on:
    issues:
       types: [closed]
jobs:
    auto_comment:
        permissions:
            issues: write
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - uses: aws-actions/closed-issue-message@v2
          with:
            # These inputs are both required
            repo-token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
            message: "Comments on closed issues are hard for our team to see." 
```
> You can do a multi line comment by using a pipe: 
```yml
message: |
